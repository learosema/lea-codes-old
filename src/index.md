# Welcome to Lea codes

Hi, I'm [Lea](https://twitter.com/lea_rosema/). I'm a frontend developer and digital artist based in Hamburg, where I happily live with my love [Angela](https://twitter.com/agalliat/).

This is my blog where I write about WebGL and creative coding stuff,
mostly for personal learning purposes, but maybe this is also helpful for other people :).

I have a [CodePen profile](https://codepen.io/terabaud/) where I code fun stuff.
Sometimes I also code using legacy technologies, like [16bit x86 assembler](https://gist.github.com/learosema/5b217f2cb8171c87c9a30a4a2957b31d).

If you love the stuff I do and want to support me, you can [buy me a fruit tea](https://ko-fi.com/learosema).
