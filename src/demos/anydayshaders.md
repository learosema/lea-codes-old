# Anydayshaders

[#anydayshaders](https://twitter.com/search?q=anydayshaders) is a challenge initiated by [ilithya](https://twitter.com/ilithya_net/). It is about creating digital arts via GLSL shaders, inspired by 100daysofcode, but without the pressure of having to commit to the challenge every day.

The background of this site was also a contribution to anydayshaders, done by [Lea](https://terabaud.github.io/).
