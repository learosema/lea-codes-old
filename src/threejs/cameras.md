## Cameras

Three.js provides several cameras. All these are based on the abtract [`Camera`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/Camera) class.

The two most common cameras used in Three.js are:

- [`PerspectiveCamera`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera) – perspective projection
- [`OrthographicCamera`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/OrthographicCamera) – orthographic projection
