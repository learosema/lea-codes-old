# Three.js

## Lights

Three.js provides several classes to add light to your scene, based on the abstract classes [`Light`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/Light) or [`LightProbe`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/LightProbe)

### Light vs LightProbe

Light probes are an alternative way of adding light to 3D scenes.
In contrast to `Light`, a `LightProbe` doesn't emit light directly and is usually generated by environment maps.

### AmbientLight

[`AmbientLight`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/AmbientLight) globally illuminates all objects in the scene equally.

- No direction, cannot be used to cast shadows
- also available as LightProbe: [`AmbientLightProbe`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/AmbientLightProbe)

### DirectionalLight

Light that gets emitted in a specific direction. It will behave as it is infinitely far away. Light rays are all cast in parallel.
This is like the sun.

This light can cast shadows, see [DirectionalLightShadow](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/shadows/DirectionalLightShadow) for details.

### HemisphereLight

[`HemisphereLight`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/HemisphereLight) is a light source positioned directly above the scene.

- light is fading from a `skyColor` to `groundColor`
- no direction
- cannot be used to cast shadows
- also available as LightProbe class: [`HemisphereLightProbe`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/HemisphereLightProbe)

### PointLight

[`PointLight`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/PointLight) emits light from a single point in all directions.

- Common use case: light bulb.
- can cast shadows, see [PointLightShadow](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/shadows/PointLightShadow)

### SpotLight

[`SpotLight`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/SpotLight) emits from a single point alonng a cone.

- can cast shadows, see [SpotLightShadow](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/shadows/SpotLightShadow)

### RectAreaLight

[`RectAreaLight`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/RectAreaLight) emits light across the face a rectangular plane.

- can be used to simulate light sources such as bright windows
- no shadow support
- only `MeshStandardMaterial` and `MeshPhysicalMaterial` are supported
- additional include needed: [`ReactAreaLightUniformsLib`](https://threejs.org/examples/jsm/lights/RectAreaLightUniformsLib.js)
