## Geometries

Three.js provides several built-in primitive objects you can use in your scene, these include planes, spheres, boxes and many more shapes.

To add a primitive object to the scene, you will need to choose a material and geometry and provide it
in the `Mesh` constructor arguments.

### Example

```js
const scene = new THREE.Scene();

// specify a sphere with radius 1 and 16 sides, 16 segments
const geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 16, 16);

// Choose a material (MeshBasicMaterial is the simplest choice, it ignores lighting)
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

scene.add(mesh);
```

### Geometry vs BufferGeometry

THREE.js releases prior to version `r125` had a `Geometry` type next to `BufferGeometry`.
`Geometry` is now deprecated and removed from its core.

All geometries are based on [`BufferGeometry`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/core/BufferGeometry).

### Building a geometry from scratch

Check out the official examples:

- [BufferGeometry with indexed faces](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_buffergeometry_indexed)
- [BufferGeometry with non-indexed faces](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_buffergeometry)

### Using SVG paths to create geometries

You can use the three.js [`Shape`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/extras/core/Shape) class to create a shape and then use a `ShapeGeometry` or `ExtrudeGeometry` to create a geometry from it.

The [example from the official the threejs site](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_geometry_extrude_shapes2.html) parses an SVG path string and converts it into a bunch of three.js [`Shape`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/extras/core/Shape) objects. It is based on a d3 plugin that is currently abandoned: [d3-threeD](https://github.com/asutherland/d3-threeD/blob/master/lib/d3-threeD.js).

Three.js also provides a ready-to-use [`SVGLoader`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#examples/en/loaders/SVGLoader) for that.

### Using text and fonts to create geometries

Three.js provides a [`FontLoader`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/loaders/FontLoader) utility class. Fonts use a [`Font`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/extras/core/Font) data structure which is an array of [`Shape`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/extras/core/Shape) representing the font. The font file needs to be provided as a JSON file which can
be generated by [facetype.js](https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/).

To create a geometry from a font, you can use [`TextGeometry`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/TextGeometry).
